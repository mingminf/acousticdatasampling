# active acoustic data sampling

I present you an active acoustic sampling mobile phone app in this code repository. 

When running on a phone, the code will actively send an audio signal to the environment to probe the phone's immediate surrounding environment and record it as a wav file in the SD card. 
Thus, make sure the phone has an SD card in it. You might need to use a file managing app (e.g., File Manager HD) to view the captured audio files. 

The recorded audio samples, technically the impulse responses of the immediate environment, can then be used for classifying the type of environment the phone is in.

This android application has been tested on Android 4.x and Android 6.0 OS. The testing devices being used are Samsung Galaxy Nexus, LG G3.  

Now this code project is currently for my students in the CSC428/CSC2514 class at University of Toronto to use. 

If you want to use the code for your own project, please contact Mingming Fan at fmmbupt@gmail.com to get the permission.

Thank you and enjoy it.
